# Deep_Learning 
WEEK 1 -> Understanding what exactly tensorflow is and how it is used deep learning. (Overview)


WEEK 2 ->   
a. Solving the tensorflow installation issues (very annoying and time taking) on windows 
            
b. After sucessfull installation, implemented the basic tf.core and tf.estimator concepts 
   from TensorFlow's official website

c. TensorFlow implemetation on MNIST dataset. 
            
d. Tensorflow with Multilayer Perception

WEEK 3 ->   

a. Keras basics and  its implementation.    

b. Basics of Autoencoders
            
c. CNN and Object Recognition with CNN using keras for dataset CIFAR 10. 
        
            
WEEK 4 ->   
a. Basics of RBMs and its comparison with Autoencoders
