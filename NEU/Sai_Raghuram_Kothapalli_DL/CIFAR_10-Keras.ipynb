    "1. Train for More Epochs. Each model was trained for a very small number of epochs, 10. It is common to train large convolutional neural networks for hundreds or thousands of epochs. I would expect that performance gains can be achieved by significantly raising the number of training epochs.\n",
    "2. Image Data Augmentation. The objects in the image vary in their position. Another boost in model performance can likely be achieved by using some data augmentation. Methods such as standardization and random shifts and horizontal image flips may be beneficial.\n",
    "3. Deeper Network Topology. The larger network presented is deep, but larger networks could be designed for the problem. This may involve more feature maps closer to the input and perhaps less aggressive pooling. Additionally, standard convolutional network topologies that have been shown useful may be adopted and evaluated on the problem.\n"
